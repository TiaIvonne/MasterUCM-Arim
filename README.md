# MasterUCM-Arima

For this practice, I decided to study Time series analysis and apply Arima or Sarima models to predict traffic flights, specifically cargo flights expressing in tons for Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands.
This dataset: Monthly figures on aviation contains relevant information from passengers, cargo, and mail movements for all airports in The Netherlands from 1999 to now.
Note: Predictions would fail or give erroneous results because the dataset doesn't consider the particular period in 2020 and above (Corona crisis etc.)
