# MasterUCM-Arima

For this practice, I decided to study Time series analysis and apply Arima or Sarima models to predict traffic flights, specifically cargo flights expressing in tons for Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands.
This dataset: Monthly figures on aviation contains relevant information from passengers, cargo, and mail movements for all airports in The Netherlands from 1999 to now.
Note: Predictions would fail or give wrong results because dataset doesn't considered special period in 2020 and above (Corona crisis etc.)

The Html file contains the following topics:
1.Exploratory data analysis.
2.Graphic representation of time series and seasonal decomposition.
3.Data partitioning, train & test.
4.Choose an exponential smoothing for the time series.
5.Correlograms and Arima modeling.
6.Adjust model.
7.Predictions.
8.Conclusions.
