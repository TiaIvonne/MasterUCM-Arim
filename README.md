# MasterUCM-Arima

For this practice, I decided to study Time series analysis and apply Arima or Sarima models to predict traffic flights, specifically cargo flights expressing in tons for Schiphol Airport, The Netherlands.
This dataset: Monthly figures on aviation contains relevant information from passengers, cargo, and mail movements for all airports in The Netherlands from 1999 to now.
Note: Predictions would fail or give wrong results because dataset doesn't considered special period in 2020 and above (Corona crisis etc.)

The Html file contains the following topics:

  <li>Exploratory data analysis
  <li>Graphic representation of time series and seasonal decomposition
  <li>Data partitioning, train & test.
  <li>Choose an exponential smoothing for the time series.
  <li>Correlograms and Arima modeling.
  <li>Adjust model.
  <li>Predictions.
  <li>Conclusions.
